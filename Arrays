1, Write a Java program to multiply corresponding elements of two arrays of integers.
Sample Output:
    Array1: [1, 3, -5, 4]
    Array2: [1, 4, -5, -2]
    Result: 1 12 25 -8

2. Write a Java program to merge two given sorted array of integers and create a new sorted array.
    array1 = [1,2,3,4]
    array2 = [2,5,7, 8]
    result = [1,2,2,3,4,5,7,8]

3. Write a Java program to calculate the median of a given unsorted array of integers.

    Original array: [10, 2, 38, 22, 38, 23]
    Median of the said array of integers: 30

    Original array: [10, 2, 38, 23, 38, 23, 21]
    Median of the said array of integers: 23

4. Write a Java program to find the new length of a given sorted array where duplicate elements appeared at most twice.

    Original array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7]
    The length of the original array is: 13
    After removing duplicates, the new length of the array is: 10

5. Write a Java program to find all of the longest word in a given dictionary.
   Example-1:
   {
       "cat",
       "flag",
       "green",
       "country",
       "London"
   }
   Result: "London"

   Example-2:
   {
       "cat",
       "dog",
       "red",
       "is",
       "am"
   }
   Result: "cat", "dog", "red"

6. Write a Java program to get the index of the first number and the last number of a subarray where the sum of numbers is zero from a given array of integers.

   Original Array : [1, 2, 3, -6, 5, 4]
   Index of the subarray of the said array where the sum of numbers is zero: [0, 3]

7. Write a Java program to remove all occurrences of a specified value in a given array of integers and return the new length of the array.

   Sample Output:
   Original array: [1, 4, 6, 7, 6, 2]
   The length of the new array is: 4

8. Write a Java program to convert an sorted array to binary search tree. Maintain minimal height of the tree.
Sample Output:
2
1
4
6
5
3

9. Write a Java program to test if the first and the last element of an array of integers are same. The length of the array must be greater than or equal to 2.
   Test Data: array = 50, -20, 0, 30, 40, 60, 10

   Sample Output:
   false

10. Write a Java program to test if the first or the last element of two array of integers are same. The length of the array must be greater than or equal to 2.
    Test Data: array1 = 50, -20, 0, 30, 40, 60, 12
    array2 = 45, 20, 10, 20, 30, 50, 11

    Sample Output:
    false
